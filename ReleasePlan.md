#### Changes included in the release

This is a brand new project and we won't have any change affecting to the current system. The project will be to create real time data processing system, which will gather user behavioral data, specifically user clicks, normalize and aggregate them, and provide statistics like average clicks count on specific screen, average time spent.

#### Potential risks
There is medium risk to not deliver the project on time since we have technical gap to fill. The project requires to use new technologies(e.g. AWS) which is new for our engineers and they will need some time to research and learn it first. They have experience with other cloud provider(e.g. GCP) and we hope that the learning should not take much time and we may vary 1-2 days from the original deadline.
